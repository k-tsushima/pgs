abstract="eMoflon is a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tool that supports rule-based unidirectional and bidirectional model transformation. eMoflon is not only being used successfully for both industrial case studies and in academic research projects, but is also consequently used to develop itself. This is known as bootstrapping and has become an important test, proof-of-concept, and success story for us. Interestingly, although MDE technologies are inherently self-descriptive and higher-order, very few actively developed MDE tools are bootstrapped. In this paper, we (i) report on the current state and focus of eMoflon, (ii) share our experience with bootstrapping in an MDE context, and (iii) provide a scalability analysis of a core component in eMoflon implemented as both a unidirectional and bidirectional model transformation with eMoflon.",
